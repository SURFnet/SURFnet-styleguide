## Building the style

For building the minified css, [recess] is used. First you need to install [nodejs], if you are on a mac you could use `brew install nodejs`.
After nodejs you need to install [npm] by `curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh` and finally you can install `recess` by `npm install recess -g`.

To build the style type `make`.
